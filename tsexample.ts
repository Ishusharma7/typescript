const num : number = 10;   

console.log(num);

let data = 10; //this is type inference it automatically tells only numbers can be assigned in later stages

let das; //this is any type anything can be stored in later stages be a number string ora boolean

let dww:5;//only 5 is assigned nothing else can be assigned mayit be a number also

const dum = 10;   //value cannot be changed work as same as above as it is assigned value of 10
